# NutriTracker
#
# This is my first dedicated project called NutriTracker
# The program is supposed to be able to collect data from nutritional labels and allow the user to keep track
# of their nutrition
# Currently the program includes a GUI, Image reading, nutritional target setting and a changelog!

# PLEASE EITHER ADD tesseract.exe TO THE TES DIRECTORY OR CHANGE THE PATH TO tesseract.exe IN menu.py
